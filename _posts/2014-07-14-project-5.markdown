# Overview
Technology alone cannot be considered a comprehensive solution to the increasingly sophisticated security threats; the employees of an organisation are actually the primary target and the weakest line of defence. When it comes to the “human factor”, security training and awareness programs are critical for maintaining up-to-date knowledge of security risk-prone activities and available mitigation measures. Unfortunately, security training awareness programs have had limited success due to their poor designs and lack of evaluations.  Therefore, in this research, we focus on understanding how to design effective security training awareness programs and evaluate their performance. Furthermore, given the rapid growth of phishing attacks, we also separately investigate how to design, implement and evaluate phishing training, education and awareness interventions to make a real difference in how we combat phishing attacks in the future.
